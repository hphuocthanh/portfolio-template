## Reflection

This was a short project in an attempt to make a portfolio using custom CSS properties, CSS Grid and Flexbox.

I coded along with the tutorial of Kevin Powel (find him on [his website](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)). I added several modifications like 'My Interests' section, added several pages for work projects and modified the CSS to my liking.

The main challenge I faced was utilizing custom CSS to the fullest. This had me finding out about how to reuse CSS effectively.

At the end of the day, it's vanilla JavaScript and heavily geared towards using CSS.
